        <p>
          Knowing when to seek medical advice is crucial for maintaining your
          health and preventing minor issues from becoming major problems. While
          some symptoms can be managed at home, others require professional
          medical attention. Here are some guidelines to help you determine when
          it’s time to see a doctor.
        </p>

        <h2 className=" text-2xl font-bold py-3">1. Persistent Symptoms</h2>
        <p>
          If you have symptoms that persist for more than a few days or weeks,
          it's important to consult a healthcare professional. This includes
          chronic pain, persistent cough, prolonged fatigue, or any other
          symptom that does not improve with home treatment.
        </p>

        <h2 className=" text-2xl font-bold py-3">2. Severe Pain</h2>
        <p>
          Severe or unexplained pain should never be ignored. Whether it's acute
          chest pain, severe abdominal pain, or intense headaches, these could
          be signs of serious conditions that require immediate medical
          attention.
        </p>

        <h2 className=" text-2xl font-bold py-3">3. Unexplained Weight Loss</h2>
        <p>
          Sudden and unexplained weight loss can be a sign of underlying health
          issues such as thyroid problems, diabetes, or even cancer. If you
          experience significant weight loss without changes to your diet or
          exercise routine, see a doctor.
        </p>

        <h2 className=" text-2xl font-bold py-3">4. Changes in Vision or Hearing</h2>
        <p>
          Any sudden or gradual changes in your vision or hearing should be
          evaluated by a healthcare professional. This includes blurred vision,
          double vision, partial or complete loss of vision, ringing in the
          ears, or hearing loss.
        </p>

        <h2 className=" text-2xl font-bold py-3">5. High Fever</h2>
        <p>
          A high fever (over 103°F or 39.4°C) or a fever that lasts more than
          three days should be assessed by a doctor. High fevers can indicate
          infections or other serious health conditions that need prompt
          treatment.
        </p>

        <h2 className=" text-2xl font-bold py-3">6. Shortness of Breath</h2>
        <p>
          Difficulty breathing or shortness of breath, especially if it comes on
          suddenly or occurs during rest, is a sign that you should seek medical
          help. It could be related to heart or lung conditions that require
          immediate attention.
        </p>

        <h2 className=" text-2xl font-bold py-3">7. Unusual Bleeding</h2>
        <p>
          Unexplained bleeding, whether it's from the nose, gums, or in your
          stool or urine, should be evaluated by a doctor. It can be a symptom
          of various medical conditions that need diagnosis and treatment.
        </p>

        <h2 className=" text-2xl font-bold py-3">8. Persistent Digestive Issues</h2>
        <p>
          If you experience ongoing digestive problems such as frequent
          heartburn, diarrhea, constipation, or abdominal pain, it’s important
          to consult a healthcare provider. These symptoms could indicate
          underlying gastrointestinal conditions.
        </p>

        <h2 className=" text-2xl font-bold py-3">9. Mental Health Concerns</h2>
        <p>
          Mental health is just as important as physical health. If you are
          experiencing persistent feelings of sadness, anxiety, or hopelessness,
          or if you have thoughts of harming yourself, seek help from a mental
          health professional immediately.
        </p>

        <h2 className=" text-2xl font-bold py-3">10. Preventive Care</h2>
        <p>
          Regular check-ups and preventive care are essential for maintaining
          good health. Even if you feel healthy, annual physical exams,
          screenings, and vaccinations can help detect potential health issues
          early and keep you up-to-date with your health.
        </p>

        <p>
          Knowing when to seek medical advice can make a significant difference
          in your health outcomes. If you are ever in doubt about a symptom or
          health concern, it is better to err on the side of caution and consult
          a healthcare professional. Your health and well-being are worth the
          effort.
